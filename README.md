# Data Structure Subject
Algoritmos e resumos aprendidos da disciplina de Estrutura de Dados e Seus Algoritmos ministrada pela prof. DSc Isabel Rosseti na Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) no semestre de 2022/01

Data structures are an important piece of computation. One of the most accepted definitions to a computer is a system tha input a certain amount of data, process this data and return this processed data.

You must organize this data throught a lot of models, wich can be more or less efficients. It will depend on case by case. However, understand a good amount of them, at least the best known, is a key to someone who will be capable of organize this data with more efficiency and, with that, be a step closer to be a good programmer.

With this in mind, a subject of Data Structures in majors and minors related to computation is more than fundamental. In "Data Structures and Their Algorithms", professor Isabel Rosseti teachs about: 
- Linked List and its variants
- Binary Tree (BT)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Graphs
- Winner Tree applied to Intercalation of Sorted Files Partitions
- AVL Tree
- B and B+ Tree
- Hash Table stored in Principal and Secondary Memory
- Binary Heap applied to Heapsort and stored in Principal and Secondary Memory.

This repository brings my resume about each topic from this subject and their algorithms as well.
